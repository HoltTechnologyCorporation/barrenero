Overview
--------

Miner code can be found in this `repository <https://github.com/PeRDy/barrenero-miner>`_.

This service aims to create a platform that provides an easy way of adding miners for different cryptocurrencies,
isolating each miner into a docker container, easy to build, update and independent of the system.

Miners currently supported:

* Ether (`ethminer <https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer>`_).
* Storj (`storj <https://storj.io/>`_).
